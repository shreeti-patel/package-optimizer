### To Do:
- [X] Add "More than box needed" for empty 
- [X] Add auto scroll to the results table being populated
- [ ] Make demo CSV have decimal point boxes
- [ ] Make sure backend logic make sense
- [ ] Add remove Box or product functionality
- [ ] Add Box name or lables (Box 1 or Box A)
- [X] Figure out 2D vs 3D visualization or do the bulk upload option 
- [ ] Write tests for backend if feeling it
- [ ] Review code base
- [X] Make front -end look nice
- [ ] Add a "clear all" button to clear all products and boxes from the input form

How is it finding a smallest box?
- Greedy Algorithm

Future implementations:
- You can add padding space for fragile items
- You can configure algorithm to avoid stacking products, so all products are visiable ofr better unboxing experience
- You can over optimize the space used by rendering the most optimimle packaging combintion of products within the box

-many ways to optimize the smallest box.. but there might be orientation contraints. don't want ot ship products upside down

Requirments for program:
- Size dimentions of avaible box sizes
- Size dimentions, sqaured off of differnt products


Benefits of smaller boxese:
- lower shipping costs
- Less packaging material
- snug fit = less damage , you can you packing paper but it costs and wastes
