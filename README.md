# **3D Box Packing Algorithm Report**  
*Optimizing Product Placement into the Smallest Possible Box*

---

## **1. Classes Overview**  

### **1.1 `Product` Class**  
**Purpose**: Represents a product to be packed.  
**Properties**:  
- `length`, `width`, `height`: Dimensions of the product (stored as doubles).
**Key Methods**:  
- `getVolume()`: Returns `length × width × height`.
- `getSmallestDimension()`: Returns the smallest dimension.

### **1.2 `Box` Class**  
**Purpose**: Represents a box that can hold products.  
**Properties**:  
- `length`, `width`, `height`: Dimensions of the box (stored as doubles).
**Key Methods**:  
- `getVolume()`: Returns the box volume.

### **1.3 `Placement` Class**  
**Purpose**: Tracks where a product is placed inside a box.  
**Properties**:  
- `x`, `y`, `z`: Coordinates of the product's bottom-left corner.
- `length`, `width`, `height`: Dimensions in current orientation.

### **1.4 `BoxRequest` & `BulkRequest` Classes**  
**Purpose**: Handles API requests for box optimization.  
**Properties**:  
- `BoxRequest`: Single order processing with products and available boxes.
- `BulkRequest`: Handles multiple orders simultaneously with shared box sizes.

## **2. Core Algorithm: `BoxOptimizationService`**  

### **2.1 `findSmallestFittingBox` & `processBulk`**  
**Purpose**: Core optimization methods.  
**Steps**:  
1. Sort boxes by volume (ascending).
2. For each order/product set:
   - Try fitting products in each box.
   - Return smallest valid box or "Multiple boxes needed".
3. Handle both single orders and bulk processing.

### **2.2 `canFitProductsInBox`**  
**Purpose**: Validates if products fit in a specific box.  
**Steps**:  
1. Sort products by volume (descending).
2. Track placements to avoid overlaps.
3. Try all rotations and positions.

### **2.3 `tryPlaceProduct`**  
**Purpose**: Attempts product placement.  
**Steps**:  
1. Check all 6 possible rotations.
2. Generate valid positions:
   - Along existing placements.
   - At origin (0,0,0).
3. Validate placement with overlap checks.

### **2.4 Rotation & Overlap Detection**  
**Purpose**: Handles 3D space management.  
**Features**:  
- Complete rotation handling (6 orientations).
- Precise overlap detection on all axes.
- Boundary validation.

## **6. Heuristic Approaches**

### **6.1 Volume-Based Sorting**
- **Box Sorting**: Boxes are sorted by volume in ascending order
  - Ensures smallest possible box is tried first
  - Reduces unnecessary attempts with larger boxes
- **Product Sorting**: Products are sorted by volume in descending order
  - Larger items are placed first, maximizing space utilization
  - Smaller items can fill remaining gaps

### **6.2 Placement Strategy**
- **First Fit Decreasing (FFD)**
  - Places products at the earliest available valid position
  - Prioritizes bottom-left corner placement
  - Reduces fragmentation of available space

### **6.3 Rotation Optimization**
- **Six Orientation Testing**
  - Tests all possible 3D rotations (6 orientations)
  - Chooses orientation that minimizes wasted space
  - Considers height constraints for stability

### **6.4 Space Utilization**
- **Bottom-Left Fill Strategy**
  - Prioritizes placing items at lowest possible position
  - Maintains center of gravity for stability
  - Reduces empty spaces between items

### **6.5 Performance Considerations**
- **Early Termination**
  - Stops searching once a valid solution is found
  - Avoids unnecessary computations for larger boxes
- **Greedy Approach**
  - Makes locally optimal choices at each step
  - Sacrifices perfect optimization for computational efficiency
  - Suitable for real-time applications

While this implementation doesn't guarantee the absolute optimal solution (due to the NP-hard nature of bin packing), these heuristics provide a practical balance between efficiency and effectiveness for real-world applications.
