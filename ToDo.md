# Future Implementations

## Product Placement Enhancements
- Add configurable padding space for fragile items
- Implement algorithm option to avoid stacking products
  - Improves unboxing experience by keeping all products visible
- Optimize space utilization by calculating the most optimal packaging combination of products within the box

## Orientation Constraints
- Implement multiple optimization strategies for finding the smallest box
- Add product orientation constraints to prevent shipping items upside down
- Support product-specific orientation requirements

## Program Requirements

### Input Requirements
- Size dimensions of available box sizes
- Size dimensions of products (squared off)
- Product-specific constraints (fragility, orientation, etc.)

### Benefits of Optimized Boxing
1. Lower Shipping Costs
   - Reduced dimensional weight
   - More efficient use of shipping space

2. Reduced Material Usage
   - Less packaging material needed
   - More environmentally friendly

3. Better Product Protection
   - Snug fit reduces movement during transit
   - Less need for additional packing materials (paper, bubble wrap)
   - Reduced shipping damage
